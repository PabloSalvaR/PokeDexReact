# PokeDex with React 
----
## Quick Overview

In this project I provide all the pokemons with their characteristics in a `virtual pokeDex. `

You can see by groups of 20 cards their `ID number, names and avatars.`

If you click on them, you can `visualize` the `specific types` and `basic stats`, like Health Power (Hp), Attack, Defense, Speed and Special Attacks.

Additionally, you have a `searchbar by type` in the left upside of the screen.
